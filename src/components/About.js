        I’ve never thought I could be so enthusiastic about something. But then
        I’ve tried coding. <br /> <br />
        After getting my master’s degree in design and architecture at the State
        Technical University of Saratov, I spent a few years working at a design
        studio, but always had a dream to move to the United States. So one day
        I got myself a one-way ticket and decided to change my life completely.
        I moved to New York in 2016 and have been bartending since then while
        trying to find my true passion. I've been interested in tech since my
        college years, and computer science classes were always a highlight of
        my week. So finally I started to code in the beginning of 2021 and I
        can't stop since then.

        I think of myself as a goal-oriented person, who is able to cultivate
        new skills and is easy to work with, a team player, who can also work
        independently. Studying and working in the architecture field helped me
        become an organized and persistent worker with attention to detail,
        while my bartending experience gave me the ability to work well under
        pressure, multitask and be able to get along with new people easily.{' '}
        <br /> <br />
        Just like architecture, which is an art used by people daily, coding is
        giving me an opportunity to create something people can interact, use
        and work with on a daily basis. This is one of the main reasons why web
        development became a part of my life.
